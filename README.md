# super-simple-flex-grid

#### What the grid is
 - An HTML centric approach to Flexbox, with emphasis on customizability through modifier classes and custom width cells

#### What the grid is not
 - Responsive: In the real world, design often requires pixel perfect implementation. Having responsive styles dictated in HTML through [viewport]-[hide/show] classes as well as custom css is a pain.
