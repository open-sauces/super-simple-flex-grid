# super-simple-flex-grid

### This grid is deprecated. CSS Grids are here!
----

### What the grid is
 - An HTML centric approach to Flexbox, with emphasis on customizability through modifier classes.

### What the grid is not
 - Viewport-specific responsive: In the real world, design often requires pixel perfect implementation. Having responsive styles dictated in HTML through [viewport]-[grow1/grow2/hide/show] classes as well as custom css is a pain and hassle to maintain.
